EDIF to UCF converter

This program takes in an EDIF netlist and creates a Xilinx-compatible 
user-constrains file (UCF). 

The EDIF netlist format was tested with that produced by Altium DXP. It's
unknown whether the program works with EDIF netlists generated by other
PCB design tools. 

The program parses the EDIF netlist, and then searches for all pins 
corresponding to the specified desginator for the FPGA. It will also
apply IO standard remappings. The code checked in is a little bit
improper in that the IO standard remappings are specific to a design.

In the future, the regex specification list should be split into
a separate file so that it's a little more modular, but at the moment
it serves as a template example for others who want to use this code.
